# Reading and Writing Files
---
Python's `open()` function is used to open a file and return a corresponding file object (e.g. - reading/writing files)

```py
#Syntax 
open(filename, mode, encoding, newline)

#Newer
with open('filename.ext', '<mode>') as alias_name:
	variable = alias_name.operation()
```
<br>

| Element  | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| filename | the path of the file you need to open                    |
| mode     | e.g.- `r` for read, `w` for write, `a` for append, etc.  |
| encoding | the encoding format, default is None                     |
| newline  | how newline mode works (i.e. `none`, `\n`, `\r\n`, `''`) |

<br>

### Notes on File operations:
- if a file doesn't exist, Python will create it
- opening an existing file in 'write' mode will *overwrite* existing content;
- if the goal is to add new content to an existing file; use 'append' instead


### Deprecated Read/Write:
#### Reading a file:
```py
# reading a file
f = open('data.txt', 'r')
file_data = f.read()
f.close()
```
<br>

#### Writing to a File:
```py
f = open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'w')
f.write("Hello World!")
f.close()
```

`f.close()` is necessary to close the file once read/write operations are complete if using the syntax `var_name = open('file_location'/file_name, 'mode')`
Having too many open files will consume and deplete machine resources resulting in a Traceback Error:
```py
files = []
for i in range(10000):
	files.append(open('some_file.txt', 'r'))
	pring(i)
	
Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "demo.py", line 3 in <module>
OSError: [Errno 24] Too man open files: 'some_file.txt'

```

### Preferred Read/Write:
See: [[6.3 -- What's with 'with']]
#### Reading/Writing (with)  [[with]]:

`with` is a special syntax that auto-closes a file once you've finished using it.
```py
with open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
	file_data = f.read()
```

This `with` keyword allows you to open a file, do operations on it, and automatically close it after the indented code is executed, in this case, reading from the file. 
This replaces the previous Python way of calling both `f.open()` and `f.close()`

You can only access the file object, `f`, within this indented block;
```py
with open('somefile.txt') as file_object:
	file_data = f.read()

print(file_object)
```
 however, you can print the content of the file object with `print()` <br>


#### Iterating Through Lines:
When we read a file, we might want to grab the whole document in a single string, like `.read()` would return. But what if we wanted to store each line in a variable? 
We can use the `.readlines()` function to read a text file line by line instead of having the whole thing. 

```txt
// keats_sonnet.txt

To one who has been long in city pent,
’Tis very sweet to look into the fair
And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer
Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
```

```py
# script.py

with open('keats_sonnet.txt') as keats_sonnet:
	for line in keats_sonnet.readlines():
	 print(line)
```
The above script creates a temporary file object called `keats_sonnet` that points to the file `keats_sonnet.txt`.
It then iterates over each line in the document and prints the entire file out.

```py
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
	for line in lines_doc.readlines():
		print(line)
```
<br>

#### Reading Line by Line:
Sometimes you don’t want to iterate through a whole file. For that, there’s a different file method, `.readline()`, which will only read a single line at a time. 
If the entire document is read line by line in this way subsequent calls to `.readline()` will not throw an error but will start returning an empty string ("").  file:

```txt 
// millay_sonnet.txt
I shall forget you presently, my dear,
So make the most of this, your little day,
Your little month, your little half a year,
Ere I forget, or die, or move away,
```

```py
# script.py
with open('millay_sonnet.txt') as sonnet_doc:
	first_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
	second_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
	print(second_line)
```
This script creates a file object called `sonnet_doc` that points to the file `millay_sonnet.txt`. 
It then reads in the first line using `sonnet_doc.readline()` and saves that to the variable `first_line`. 
It then saves the second line (So make the most of this, your little day,) into the variable `second_line` and then prints it out.
