```py
"""
Consider a list (list = [])
You can perform the following commands:
1. insert i e (i.e. - insert integer e at position i)
2. print
3. remove e (delete the firs occurrence of integer e)
4. append e (insert integer at the end of the list)
5. sort 
6. pop (pop the last element from the list)
7. reverse

Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above.
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
