# Errors and Exceptions
---
In Python, there are two common types of errors to watch out for:
+ Exceptions
+ Syntax

An **Exception** is a problem that occurs when the code is running, whereas a **Syntax Error** is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs. For more information, see the Python tutorial page on [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

---
All Errors:
+ `SyntaxError` - Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language
+ `NameError` - Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown
+ `TypeError` - Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type
+ `IndentationError` - Error thrown when one or more lines are not indented correctly


---
`Exception` is the base class for all built-in exceptions.

### Accessing Error Messages:
When you handle an exception, you can still access its error message like this:
```py
# without specific error handling
try:
	# some code
except Exception as e:
	# some code
	print("Exception occurred: {}".format(e))
	

# with custom error handling
try:
	# some code
except ZeroDeivisionError as e:
	# some code
	print("ZeroDivisionError occurred: {}".format(e))
-----------------------------------------------------
# ZeroDivisionError occurred: integer division or modulo by zero
```
