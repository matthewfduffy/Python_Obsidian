# Errors and Exceptions

In Python, there are two common types of errors to watch out for:
+ **Exceptions** occur when unexpected things happen during execution of a program, even if the code is syntactically correct.
+ **Syntax errors** occur when Python cannot interpret our code, since we didn't follow the correct syntax.

>An **Exception** is a problem that occurs when the code is running, whereas a **Syntax Error** is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs. 

For more information, see the Python tutorial page on [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

Common Errors:
+ `SyntaxError` - Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language
+ `NameError` - Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown
+ `TypeError` - Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type
+ `IndentationError` - Error thrown when one or more lines are not indented correctly

Specific Errors:
+ `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` - Error thrown when trying to divide an integer by 0
+ `SyntazError: unexpected EOF while parsing` - Error often produced when leaving out something (e.g. - parentheses). The message is saying it has unexpectedly reached the end of file ("EOF") and it still didn't find the right parenthesis
