## Filter()
The filter method filters a given [[iterable]]  with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not.

`filter()` removes the elements from a list that do not meet certain criteria.

> The `filter()` function will "filter out" an iterable object based on a specified condition.

##### Syntax:
`filter(function, iterable)`

> ***NOTE:*** `filter()` returns a `<filter_object>`, so it needs to be casted to another data-type to be used.


##### Example:
```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

check_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
even_numbers = list(filter(check_even, numbers))
print(even_numbers)
-----------------------------------------------
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```
The above code will filter out all even numbers from the list.
`check_even` is a [[lambda]] function that checks whether a number is even.
The filter method is filtering all even numbers from the list.
It returns the number if it is even, otherwise ignores the number.


```py
nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
# [2, 4, 6]
```

### Filter with Lambda
The following code uses `filter()` to get the names in `cities` that are fewer than 10 characters long to create the list `short_cities`
```py
cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Denver", "Mountain View", "Boston"]

def is_short(name):
	return len(name) < 10

short_cities = list(filter(is_short, cities))
print(short_cities)
```
The code above can be rewritten with a `lambda` expression to make the code more concise:
```py
short_cities = list(filter(lambda x: len(x)))
