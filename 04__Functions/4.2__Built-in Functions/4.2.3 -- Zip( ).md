## Zip()
The `zip()` function allows us to quickly combine associated data-sets without needing to rely on multi-dimensional lists.

The function takes two or more iterables as input, aggregates them in an object, and returns it.

> zip can accept any type of iterable such as files, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.

#### Syntax:
```python
# syntax
zip(*iterable)
```
<br>

#### Example(s):
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
characters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

zipped = zip(numbers, characters)
# variable = function (input 1, input 2)

print(zipped)	# zip object
# <zip object at 0x013A5808>

# retrieve values from a zipped object by using any iterable
# (i.e. - list, tuple, set)

print(list(zipped))	
[(1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C'), (4, 'D')]

print(tuple(zipped))
((1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C'), (4, 'D'))
--------------------------------
# notice inner lists don't use `[]` brackets

# Using zip function to unzip already zipped object to retrieve iterables/values

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
characters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
zipped = zip(numbers, characters)

n,c = zip(*zipped)
print(n)
print(c)
------------------------------------
[1, 2, 3, 4]
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```

### Combining Lists of Different Sizes
When you combine lists of different lengths, the `zip()` function ignores everything that passes the shortest list.
```python
player_numbers = [7, 9]
player_names = ['Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Gareth Bale', 'Lionel Messi']

player_data = zip(player_numbers, player_names)

print(list(player_data))
# Output:
[(7, 'Cristiano Ronaldo'), (9, 'Gareth Bale')]
```

![[4.2.3_Zip_Diff_Lengths.png]]

If you don’t want the last values to be ignored, you can use the `zip_longest()` function. This function is part of the `Itertools` module, so make sure to import it.

```python
from itertools import zip_longest

player_numbers = [7, 9]
player_names = ['Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Gareth Bale', 'Lionel Messi']

player_data = zip_longest(player_numbers, player_names)

print(list(player_data))
# Output:
[(7, 'Cristiano Ronaldo'), (9, 'Gareth Bale'), (None, 'Lionel Messi')]
```

This function replaces the missing value pair with `None` by default. This can be changed too. If you want to show `0` instead of `None`, you can define the optional `fillvalue` argument:

```python
player_data = zip_longest(player_numbers, player_names, fillvalue=0)
```


### Unzip
There’s no built-in `unzip()` function in Python. Instead, you can use the `zip()` function “in reverse” to tear apart zipped data. In this case, you also need to use the asterisk (`*`).

![[4.2.3_Zip_Unzip.png]]
```python
player_data = [(7, 'Cristiano Ronaldo'), (9, 'Gareth Bale'), (10, 'Lionel Messi')]

numbers, names = zip(*player_data)

print(numbers)
print(names)

# Output:
(7, 9, 10)  
('Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Gareth Bale', 'Lionel Messi')
```
