## Map()
`map()` is a higher-order #built-in-function that takes two arguments: 
1. the function we want to apply, and
2. the [[iterable]] object or sequence we want to apply it to. 

Map returns an [[iterator]] that applies the function to each element of the iterable.

> the `map()` function provides a way to apply a function to each element in an iterable object. (e.g. - replaces a [[for]] loop)

##### Syntax:
`map(function, iterable)`

> ***NOTE:*** `map()` returns a `<map_object>` and needs to be casted to another data-type.

##### Use Case:
 You have a list that you want to apply some operation or function to each element in the list, and return a new list

##### Example: 
You have a list of numbers and want to create a new list that contains their squares.

Numbers to Squares (without Map):
```python
# defining a function that returns the square of a number

def squared(num):
	return num**2

num_list = [1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	# orginal list
		

# using a for loop to iterate over num_list
# creates a new list with squared values

num_list_squared = []

for num in num_list:
	num_list_squared.append(squared(num))

print(num_list_squared)		# [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

Numbers to Squares using `map()`:
```python
# with map()
def squared(num):
	return num**2

num_list = [1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	# orginal list

# using the map function to create a new list of squared values

num_list_squared = list(map(squared, num_list))

print(num_list_squared)			# [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

```


### Map() with [[lambda]]
Higher-order functions like `map()` work especially well with lambda functions. Because lambda functions are anonymous, we don’t need to define a new named function for `map()` if that function won’t be used again elsewhere.

You can use `map()` with `lambda` when you need to use a [[function]] as an [[argument]].
```python
# example with map() and lambda
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

times_two = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)

print(list(times_two))
# [2, 4, 6, 8]
``` 

```python
# map without lambda
def cube(n):
	return n * n * n
	

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cubes = list(map(cube, numbers))
print(cubes)
# [1, 8, 27, 63, 125]
```
Using a lambda function with `map()` produced the same output as when the custom `cube()` function was passed to `map()`, but it only required one line of code instead of three.

```python
# map with lambda
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cubes = list(map(lambda x: x*x*x, numbers))

print(cubes)
------------
# [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

##### Advanced Examples:
The code below uses `map()` to find the mean of each list in *numbers* to create the list *averages*.
```python
numbers = [
			[34, 63, 88, 71, 29],
			[90, 78, 51, 27, 45],
			[63, 37, 85, 46, 22],
			[51, 22, 34, 11, 18]
		   ]
		   
def mean(num_list):
	return sum(num_list) / len(num_list)

# lambda with map
averages = list(map(mean, numbers))
print(averages)

# output
#>>> [57.0, 58.2, 50.6, 27.2]
```
