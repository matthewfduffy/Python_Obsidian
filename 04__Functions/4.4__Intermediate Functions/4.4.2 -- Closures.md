# Closures

A closure is a concept which maintains the references of the objects from outer scopes.
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from a local function.

Closures are nested functions that capture non-local variables of the outer functions.
```python
def multiply_by(x):
	def inner(y):
		return x * y
	return inner

multiply_by_two = multiply_by(2)

multiply_by_two(10) #20 

```


The closure is also used to generate a [[function factory]]. 
> **Function factory**, a function that generates new, specialized functions.


[higher-order functions] functions that use other functions as input and output

```python
# create a closure
def make_multiplier(coefficient):	# outer function
	product = 1
	
	def multiplier():		# nested function
		nonlocal product		# non local variable
		product *= coefficient
		return product
	
	return multiplier		# outer function returns inner function
	
	
multiplier3 = make_multiplier(3)

>>> multiplier3()
3
>>> multiplier3()
9
>>> multiplier3()
27
>>> multiplier3.__code__.co_freevars	# variable binding
('coefficient', 'product')
>>> multiplier3.__closure__[1].cell_contents	#value capturing
27
```

1. `make_multiplier()` is the outer function
2. `multiplier()` is the nested function
3. The outer function returns the nested function as its return value
4. The nested function uses and modifies a *non-local* variable defined within the scope of the outter function

Everytime we call the multiplier3, the product is multiplied by three and the closure remembers the state of the product after it's last use.





```python
def outer():
	x = 'python'
	
	def inner():
		print("{0} rocks!".format(x))	# x refers to the x in outer's scope; nonlocal variable
	
	inner()
outer()		# => python rocks!
```

In the example above, the closure is this block:
```python
...
	x = 'python'
	
	def inner():
		print("{0} rocks!".format(x))
```
