## Type Hints
Unlike other languages, in Python you do not need to specify the data-type while creating a variable because the type [of variable] is linked to the object rather than the name.

This helps with code-readability and development speed, but for larger projects it helps to know which object types are connected with particular variables -- especially libraries that are utilized by third-parties.

Variable Declaration in Java:
```java
String name = "Matt";
```

Variable Declaration in Python (without Type Hints):
```python
name = "Matt"
```



Type hints within a Python project are ignored at runtime; their purpose is meant more for developers than anything functional.
