# Functions Basics
[[function]]s are a convenient way to group our code into reusable blocks.

```py
# syntax for a function
def some_function(a, b):
	return a * b	
```

When you use functions you have to always think of both parts: 
	(1) the code that defines the function and 
	(2) the code that calls the function
	
	
### Constructing Functions:
+ [[function]]s begin with the keyword `def` (function header) and ends in `:`
+ Following the [[def]] keyword is the name of the function
	+ Rules for function names are the same as the rules for variable names
+ After the function name in `( )` are the [[argument]]s the function expects, separated by `,`
	+ If a function is written that doesn't expect arguments then leave the `( )` empty
+ Lastly, one or more valid, indented Python statements that make up the function body and where the core work of the function takes place

*These steps constitute "Defining a function"*

```py
	# example function with no arguments
	def print_greeting():
		print('Hello World!')
```

+ **variables** defined within a function are referred to as**local variables**and can only be used/accessed within the body of the function; known as [[Variable Scope]]
+ For a function to execute, a function call must be placed.
	+ Note: A function must be be defined before (positioned above) it is called because of Python's *execution flow* which runs a program line-by-line from top-down
	+ For functions that expect one or more arguments, the function call must also include [[parameter]]s
	
```py
#example function using return
def cylinder_volume(height, radius):
	pi = 3.14159
	return height * pi * radius ** 2

#function call
cylinder_volume(10, 3)
```

Typically we use the  [[return]] keyword to send back the result of the function instead of just printing it out. 
	 `return` allows us to assign the output of the function to a new variable whereas `print()` outputs results only to the console.

Demonstrating why `print` does not work in functions
```py
def add_function(num1, num2):
	print(num1 + num2)
	
result = add_function(1, 2)
print(result)
---------------
>>> 3 # expected but this is printing from within the function

result = result + 10
print(result)
---------------
#>>> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and int
```

Using `return`:
```py
def add_function(num1, num2):
	return num1 + num2

result = add_function(1,2)
print(result)
# >>> 3	# expected; printing from print() function	

result = result + 10
print(result)
---------
# 13 # expected
```

---
---
```py
def name_of_function(name):
	#optional docstring
	'''
	Docstring explains function.
	'''
	print("Hello " + name)
	

# >>> name_of_function("Matt")
# >>> Hello Matt
```
