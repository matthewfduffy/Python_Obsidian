# Unpacking Args, Kwargs

Let’s imagine we want to sum a few numbers together:

```py
def sum(num1, num2, num3):  
	print(num1 + num2 + num3)
```

Right now, our function forces us to pass in an individual argument for `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`. This isn’t a big issue if we have separate variables or know our numbers in advance. However, what if we wanted to use a list like `[3, 6, 9]` instead? Well, that is where the unpacking operator comes to the rescue.

Let’s observe:

```py
my_num_list = [3, 6, 9] 

def sum(num1, num2, num3):  
	print(num1 + num2 + num3) 

sum(*my_num_list)
# >>> 18
```

By using the unpacking operator (`*`) we are spreading the contents of our list `my_num_list` into the individual arguments in our function definition. We are immediately saved the hassle of writing loops and are given the flexibility to use any iterable with three elements.

This way of using the `*` in a function call also applies to our keyword operator `**`. As long as the keywords match the function parameter names, we can accomplish the same goal:

```py
numbers  = {'num1': 3, 'num2': 6, 'num3': 9} 

def sum(num1, num2, num3):  
	print(num1 + num2 + num3) 
	
sum(**numbers)
# >>> 18
```

We can even use the operators inside of built-in functions. For example, instead of manually providing the `range()` built-in function with a start and stop value, we can unpack a list directly into it. Let’s take a look:

```py
start_and_stop = [3, 6] 

range_values = range(*start_and_stop)

print(list(range_values))
# >>> [3, 4, 5]
```

The possibilities of using the `*` and `**` operators are endless. Observe some more clever use cases:

###### Unpacking parts of an iterable:
```py
 a, *b, c = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15] 
	 
print(b)
# >> [6, 9, 12]
```
    

###### Merging iterables:
```py
 my_tuple = (3, 6, 9)
 
 merged_tuple = (0, *my_tuple, 12)
 
 print(merged_tuple)
 # >>> (0, 3, 6, 9, 12)
```
    
    
###### Combining unpacking and packing:
    
```py
num_collection = [3, 6, 9] 

def power_two(*nums):   
	for num in nums:    
		print(num**2)
		
		
power_two(*num_collection)
# >>> 9 
# >>> 36
# >>> 81
```
