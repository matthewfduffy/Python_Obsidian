## Virtual Env Setup
```sh
# In Parent Directory
$ mkdir new_project_name
$ cd new_project_name
$ #virtual environment command

```

## Standard Flask program:
```python
from flask import Flask		#from flask package import 'Flask' class
app = Flask(__name__)		#creating application object as an instance of the class 'Flask' which was imported from flask package above

# __name__ variable is a predefined variable that is set to the name of the module in which it is used. 
#Answers question: "Are we running this script directly?"

#once application is created we can define pages

@app.route('/')			#decorator that links path to page
def index():
	return '<h1>Hello Puppy!</h1>'
	
if __name__ == '__main__':		#if you're running this script, then run the application
	app.run()
	
```


## Basic Routes:
Routes are defined with the `app.route()` decorator:

```python
#from flask import Flask
#app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')		# 127.0.0.1:5000
def index():
	...
	
@app.route('/information')		# 127.0.0.1:5000/information
def info():
	...

#if __name__ == "__main__":
#	app.run()
```


## Dynamic Routes:
Dynamic Routes have two key aspects:
	1. A variable in the route `<variable>` decorator
	2. A parameter passed in to the function that the decorator is decorating
	
```python
@app.route('/some_page/<name>')
def other_page(name):
	return 'User: {}'.format(name)
```

example:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/puppy/<name>')
def puppy(name):
	return "<h1> This is a page for {}</h1>".format(name)
	
	
if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()

```

The URL rules of Flask are based on Werkzeug's routing module to ensure URLs formed are unique and based on precedents followed by Apache.

```python

@app.route('/flask')
def hello_flask():
	return 'Hello Flask'
	
@app.route('/python/')	#trailing slash becomes a cononical URL
def hello_python():
	return 'Hello Python'
	
#using '/python' or '/python/' returns the same output whereas using '/flask/' will result in 404 Error

```

## Run Flask App:
```sh
$ python app.py # or main file

```

## Flask Debug:
By setting `debug=True` in `app.run()` you can debug the application during development from the browser:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(debug=True)
```

To debug (in the browser) you will need the PIN generated when the app starts:
```sh
D:\Code\Flask_Apps\lesson_63
(myenv) Î» python app.py
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 905-945-348
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
