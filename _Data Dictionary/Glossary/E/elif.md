## elif
`elif` statement checks another condition after the previous [[if]] statement conditions are not met.
We can use `elif` statements to control the order we want our program to check each of our conditional statements.

```py
if some_condition:
	#execute some code
elif some_other_condition:
	#do something different
else:
	#do something else
```
