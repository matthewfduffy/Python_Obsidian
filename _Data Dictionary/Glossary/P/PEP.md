## **PEP**
Python Enhancement Proposal. 

A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment.
PEPs should provide a concise technical specification and a rationale for proposed features.

PEPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python.
The PEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
