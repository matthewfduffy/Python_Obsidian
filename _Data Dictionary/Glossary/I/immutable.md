## immutable
An object with a fixed value.
Immutable objects include numbers, strings, and tuples.
Such an object cannot be altered.

A new object has to be created if a different value is required to be stored. 
Immutable objects play an important role in places where a constant *hash* value is needed, for example as a key in a *dictionary*
