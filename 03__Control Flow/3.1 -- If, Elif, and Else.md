## If, Elif, and Else & Comparison and Logical Operators
---

Comparison and Logical operators:
`<, >, ==, !=`
`AND, OR`

> **Control Flow** is used when we only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met.

To control the flow of logic we use some keywords:
- [[if]]
- [[elif]]
- [[else]]

*Control Flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation(white-space)*

Syntax of an **if** statement:
```py
if some_condition:
	#execute some code
```

Syntax of an **if/else** statement:
```py
if some_condition:
	#execute some code
else:
	#do something else
```

Syntax using **elif**:
```py
if some_condition:
	#execute some code
elif some_other_condition:
	#do something different
else:
	#do something else
```
