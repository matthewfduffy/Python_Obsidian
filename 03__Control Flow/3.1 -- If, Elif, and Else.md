## If, Elif, and Else + Comparison and Logical Operators

### If Statement
An `if` statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false.
```python
if phone_balance < 5:
	phone_balance += 10
	bank_balance -= 10
```

An `if` statement starts with the [[if]] keyword, followed by the condition to be checked, ending in a colon `:`

The condition is specified in a boolean expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`

After the `if` statement is an indented block of code to be executed should that condition be true. If not, the code in the `if` block is skipped.

### If...Else


### If...Elif...Else
In addition to the `if/else` clause, there is an optional clause often used to check against multiple conditions:
```python
if season == 'spring':
	print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
	print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
	print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
	print('stay indoors!')
else:
	print('unrecognized season')
```

`elif` is short for "else if" and uses the keyword [[elif]] to check for one or more additional conditions if the condition in the initial `if` clause evaluates to `False`

`else` will always be the last statement in an `if/elif` statement and uses the [[else]] keyword. The code in an `else` block is run if all conditions above it evaluate to `False`
