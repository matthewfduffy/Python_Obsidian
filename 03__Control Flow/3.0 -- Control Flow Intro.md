# Control Flow
**Control Flow** is used when we only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met.

Control flow is achieved through the use of:
+ Conditional Statements
	+ using [[if]], [[elif]], [[else]] keywords, with:
	+ [[1.1 --  Data Types & Operators#Comparison Operators | Comparison Operators]]


+ Boolean Expressions
	+ using [[and]], [[or]], [[not]], [[any]], [[all]]

	+ using [[for]]keyword
+ While Loops
	+ using [[while]] keyword


+ Break and Continue
