# For Loops
Redirect from: [[3.2 -- Loops Intro (For and While)]]

See also: [[]] break and continue

## Examples:
#### For Loops with different data-types:
###### List
```py
#iterate through a list
seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for item in seq:
	print(item)
	# prints 1 2 3 4 5
	
# single-line
for item in seq: print(item)
```
<br>

###### String
```py
#iterate through string
mystring = 'hello'

for char in mystring:
	print(char)
	# prints h e l l o
	
# single-line
for char in mystring: print(char)
```
<br>

###### Dictionary
```py
#iterate through dictionary
salaries = {'John':10, 'Sally': 20, 'Lisa': 30}

for key in salaries:
	print(key)
	#prints John Sally Lisa
	
for employee in salaries:
	print(employee)
	print("has a salary of: ")
	print(salaries[employee])
	print(' ')
	#prints John n\ has a salary of: n\ 10
```
<br>

###### Tuple
```py
#iterate list of tuples
mypairs = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

for item in mypairs:
	print(item)
	#prints ('a', 1) ('b', 2) ('c', 3)
	
	# a list of tuples is common and 
	# can be expedited by tuple-unpacking
-----------------------------------------
# TUPLE UNPACKING	
for (item1, item2) in mypairs:
	print(item1)
	print(item2)
	
	#will print all letters followed by all numbers

for letter, num in mypairs:
	print(num)
	#prints all numbers
```
<br>

## Considerations:
#### Temporary Variables:
A temporary variable’s name is arbitrary and does not need to be defined beforehand. Both of the following code snippets do the exact same thing:
 ```py
for i in ingredients:  print(i)
```

```py
for item in ingredients: print(item)
```

> Programming best practices suggest we make our temporary variables as descriptive as possible. <br>
> Since each iteration (step) of our loop is accessing an ingredient it makes more sense to call our temporary variable `ingredient` rather than `i` or `item`.
<br>

#### Indentation:
Everything at the same level of indentation after the `for` loop declaration is included in the loop body and is run on every iteration of the loop.

```py
for ingredient in ingredients:  
# Any code at this level of indentation   
# will run on each iteration of the loop  
	print(ingredient)
```

Forgetting to indent will throw an `IndentationError`
<br>

#### Elegant Loops:
Python lets us write simple `for` loops in one line.
```py
for ingredient in ingredients: print(ingredient)
```

> Note: It is not recommended to write one-line loops for any action the performs multiple actions on each iteration.

Other For Loop Examples:
```python
#print a list of numbers

for x in range(0,5):
	print(x)
	#prints 0-4
	
for x in range(0,11,2):	#step iterator
	print (x)
	#prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
	
#if you don't want python to print you can **cast** to a variable

result = list(range(0,11,2))
print(result)

#prints [0,2,4,6,8,10]
```
