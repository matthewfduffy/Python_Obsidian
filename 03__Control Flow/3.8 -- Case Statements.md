## Case Statements
With versions of Python 3.10+ **structural pattern matching** has been added in the form of _match_ and _case_ statements.

Pattern matching enables programs to extract information from complex data types, branch on the structure of data, and apply specific actions based on different forms of data.

A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks.
Specifically, pattern matching operates by:
1. Using data with type and shape (the subject)
2. evaluating the subject in the match statement
3. comparing the subject with each pattern in a case statement from top to bottom until a match is confirmed
4. executing the action associated with the pattern of the confirmed match
5. If an exact match is not confirmed, the last case, a wildcard `_`, if provided, will be used as the matching case. If an exact match is not confirmed and a wildcard case does not exist, the entire match block is a no-op.

#### Syntax:
```python
match subject:
	case <pattern_1>:
		<action_1>
	case <pattern_2>:
		<action_2>
	case <pattern_3>:
		<action_3>
	case _:
		<action_wildcard>
```
