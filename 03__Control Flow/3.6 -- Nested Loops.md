# Nested Loops
Some situations require the use of nested loops.

Suppose you are in charge of a science class that is split into three project teams.
```py
project_teams =Â [["Ava", "Samantha", "James"], ["Lucille", "Zed"], ["Edgar", "Gabriel"]]
```
A for loop can be used to get each team, but what if we wanted to print each individual student?
```py
# standard for loop
for team in project_teams:
	print(team)
---------------------------
# ["Ava", "Samantha", "James"]
# ["Lucille", "Zed"]
# ["Edgar", "Gabriel"]

# Nested for loop
for team in projec_teams:
	for student in team:
		print(student)
----------------------------
# Ava
# Samantha
# James
# Lucille
# Zed
# ....
```
