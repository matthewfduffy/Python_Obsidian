 You can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well. The continue
statement will continue to the next value of the for loop’s counter, as if the program
execution had reached the end of the loop and returned to the start. In fact, you can
use continue and break statements only inside while and for loops. If you try to use
these statements elsewhere, Python will give you an error.

# Continue

```py
number_list = [1, 2, -1, 4, -5, 5, 2, -9]

for i in number_list"
	if i <= 0:
		continue
	print(i)

# 1, 2, 4, 5, 2
