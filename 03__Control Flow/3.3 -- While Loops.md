# While Loops

Use `while` loops when the number of times the loop is executed depends on how many times a condition is met.

#### Considerations:
`while` loops require some form of a variable to track the condition of the loop for starting and stopping.

Since length is predetermined, we can use the length of a list as the basis for how long our `while` loop needs to run.

```python
length = len(ingredients)
index = 0

while index < length:
	print(ingredients[index])
	index += 1
```




## Examples:
```python
i = 1
while i < 5:
	print(f"i is currently: {i})
	i = i + 1	
	#without increment the loop will always print "i is currently 1"
	
spam = 0
while spam < 5:
	print('Hello World')
	spam = spam +1
```

```python
# codecademy
python_topics = ["variables", "control flow", "loops", "modules", "classes"]



length = len(python_topics)
index = 0

while index < length:
	print('I am learning about ', python_topics[index])
	index += 1
```

#### Elegant Loops:
Python lets us write simple `while` loops in one line.
```python
count = 0
while count <= 3: print(count); count += 1
```
