# Loops
Loops are used to simplify repeated actions such as iterating over a collection of items.

In Python, there are two types of loops:
+ [[while]] loops
+ [[for]] loops

```python
# syntax of a While Loop
while some_boolean_condition:
	do something
```

```python
# syntax of a For Loop
for item in object:
	action
```


### Which Loop to Use?:
Determining which type of loop to use depends on the type of iteration needed:
+ *Indefinite iteration,*  where the number of times the loop is executed depends on how many times a condition is met. [While Loop]
 
+ *Definite iteration,*  where the number of times the loop will be executed is defined in advanced (usually based on collection size). [For Loop]

> Note: While loops require some form of variable to track the condition of the loop to start/stop.


#### Summary of Differences between While and For Loops:
| **Type**  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| While | Iterates through a block of code and will return to the beginning of the execution block ***until the specified parameter is met*** |
| For   | Iterates through a block of code and executes ***a specified number of times***                                                          |
                                                                                    

#### Basic For/While Loop Examples:
##### While Loop:
```python
count = 0
while count <= 3:
	print(count)
	count += 1		# without this while loop with be infinite
```


##### For Loop:
```python
# print a list of numbers using range()
for x in range(0,5):
	print(x)	# prints 0-4
```






Special: 'In' keyword:
```py
#use IN to check if a value is in an iterable element (strings and lists)

print(1 in [1,2,3])
#True

print('s' in 'Applesauce')
#True

print('z' in 'Bicycle')
#False
```

	Break and Continue:
	> Use 'break' to exit a loop without rechecking if the condition is true
	> Use 'continue' to return to the start of the loop and recheck the condition

```py
#example with break

name = ' '
while True:
	print('Please type your name: ')
	name = input()
	if name == 'your name':
		break
print('Thank you!')


#example of continue
spam = 0
while spam < 5:
	spam = spam + 1
	if spam == 3:
		continue
	print('spam is ' + str(spam))
```
