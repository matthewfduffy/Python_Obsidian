# Strings
---
> **Strings** are an **immutable**, **ordered** sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single `'` or double`"` quotes.

	'This is a string'
	"This is also a string"
	"don't do that - is also a string"
	
Because strings are **ordered sequences,** it means we can use **INDEXING** and **SLICING** to grab sub-sections of the string.

> #Syntax
> [Start : Stop : Step]
> *Start*:  is a numerical index for the slice start
> *Stop*:  is the index that you will go up to but not include
> *Step*:  is the size of the 'jump' you take


#### Slicing:

```Py
#Slicing
mystring = "abcde"

print(mystring[0:3])
>>> abc

print(mystring[:3])
>>>

print(mystring[2:])
>>>

print(mystring[::])	#start from beginning go all the way to the end.
>>> abcde			#will return full string

print(mystring[::2])	#go from beginning to end; step by two
>>>

print(mystring[::-1])	#go from beginning to end, but start at end
>>> edcba				#reverses string	# Reverse String
```



#### Built-In Functions

```py

len()	#returns the length of a string

print(len("python"))
>>> 6

mystring = "python"
print(len(mystring[1]))
>>> y

#A method is an action that python can perform on a piece of data

title()	#Displays each word in titlecase, where each word begins with a capital letter

name = "matt duffy"
print(name.upper())
>>> Matt Duffy


upper()		#displays each letter in uppercase
lower()		#displays each letter in lowercase

name = "Matt Duffy"
print(name.upper())
>>> MATT DUFFY

print(name.lower())
>>> matt duffy


rstrip(), lstrip(), strip()

favorite_language = ' python '

favorite_language.rstrip()
>>> ' python'

favorite_language.lstrip()
>>> 'python '

favorite_language.strip()
>>> 'python'


split()		#splits a string into a list based on white-space

mystring = 'Hello World'

print(mystring.split())
>>> ['Hello', 'World']

print(mystring.split('W'))
>>> ['Hello', 'orld']
```
