# Strings
**Strings** are an **immutable**, **ordered** sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single `'` or double`"` quotes.

	'This is a string'
	"This is also a string"
	"don't do that - is also a string"
	

#### Escaping Strings:
To use apostrophe's `'` in Python, you either need to:
- Escape the sequence using an escape `\` character
- Use a mixture of double `" "` or single `''` quotes

```python

# Escaping the string
this_string = 'Simon\'s skateboard is in the garage.'

# Combining double and single quotes
this_string = "Simon's skateboard is in the garage."
```



#### Combining Strings:
```python
first_word = 'Hello'
second_word = 'World'

print(first_word + second_word)
# HelloWorld

print(first_word + ' ' + second_word)
# Hello World
```


#### Repeating Strings:
```python
first_word = "Hello"

print(first_word * 5)
# HelloHelloHelloHelloHello
```

Because strings are **ordered sequences,** it means we can use **INDEXING** and **SLICING** to grab sub-sections of the string.

> #Syntax
> [Start : Stop : Step]
> *Start*:  is a numerical index for the slice start
> *Stop*:  is the index that you will go up to but not include
> *Step*:  is the size of the 'jump' you take


#### Slicing:
```Python
#Slicing
mystring = "abcde"

print(mystring[0:3])
>>> abc

print(mystring[:3])
>>>

print(mystring[2:])
>>>

print(mystring[::])	#start from beginning go all the way to the end.
>>> abcde			#will return full string

print(mystring[::2])	#go from beginning to end; step by two
>>>

print(mystring[::-1])	#go from beginning to end, but start at end
>>> edcba				#reverses string	# Reverse String
```


#### String Methods
See Also: [[2.1.0 -- String Methods Index]]

A _method_ in Python behaves similarly to a function in that methods are functions that are called using dot `.` notation.
Methods are specific to the datatype for a particular variable, so there are some methods that are similar and different across data-types.

Additionally, some methods receive additional arguments whereas others don't.
```python
my_string = "My Name"

my_string.islower()		# True
my_string.count('m') 	# 2
my_string.find('a')		# 4
```

In the example above, `count` and `find` methods both take another argument. However, the `.islower()` method does not accept another argument.

No one is expected to memorize all methods, which is why understanding how to use documentation is so important.
