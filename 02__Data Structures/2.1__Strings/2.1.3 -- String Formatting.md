# String Formatting
String formatting is a way to pull dynamic values into a static string.

### .format()
```python
name = 'Matt'

# option 1
greeting = "Hello! My name is {}."
print(greeting.format(name))
# Hello! My name is Matt

# option 2
name = 'Matt'
print("Hello! My name is {}.".format(name))
# Hello! My name is Matt
```


### [[f-string]]
New with v.3.6 and later
```python
my_name = 'Matt'
my_dogs_name = 'Duncan'

print(f"Hello! My name is {my_name} and my dog's name is {my_dogs_name}.")
# "Hello! My name is Matt and my dog's name is Duncan."
```
