# List Comprehensions with Dictionaries
---
Python allows you to create a dictionary using a list comprehension by combining two lists.

Syntax:
`dictionary_name = {key:value for key, value in zip(list_1, list_2)}`

Ex. -
```py
names = ['Jenny', 'Alexus', 'Sam', 'Grace']
heights = [61, 70, 67, 74]

students = {key:value for key, value in zip(names, heights)}
print(students)
# {'Jenny': 61, 'Alexus': 70, 'Sam': 67, 'Grace': 74}

```
Remember that zip() combines two lists into a zipped list of pairs. This list comprehension:

1.  Takes a pair from the zipped list of pairs from names and heights   
2.  Names the elements in the pair key (the one originally from the names list) and value (the one originally from the heights list)
3.  Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
4.  Repeats steps 1-3 for the entire list of pairs

You can also use `zip()` first:
```py
drinks = ["espresso", "chai", "decaf", "drip"]
caffeine = [64, 40, 0, 120]

zipped_drinks = zip(drinks, caffeine)

drinks_to_caffeine = {key: value for key, value in zipped_drinks}

```
