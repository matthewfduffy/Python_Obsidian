# Checking Data Types with `type()`
---

We can check the type of a Python variable using the `type()` function.
```py
a_string = "Cool String"
an_int = 12

print(type(a_string))
# prints "<class 'str'>"

print(type(an_int))
# prints "<class 'int'>"
```
Above, we defined two variables, and checked the type of these two variables. 

A variable’s type determines what you can do with it and how you can use it. 
You can’t .get() something from an integer, just as you can’t add two dictionaries together using +. 
This is because those operations are defined at the type level.
