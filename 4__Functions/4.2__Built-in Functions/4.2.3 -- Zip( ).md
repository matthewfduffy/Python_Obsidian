## Zip()
The `zip()` function allows us to quickly combine associated data-sets without needing to rely on multi-dimensional lists.

The function takes two or more iterables as input, aggregates them in an object, and returns it. 

> zip can accept any type of iterable such as files, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.

Syntax:
```py
# syntax
zip(*iterable)
```
<br>

Example(s):
```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
characters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

zipped = zip(numbers, characters)
# variable = function (input 1, input 2)

print(zipped)	# zip object
# <zip object at 0x013A5808>

# retrieve values from a zipped object by using any iterable
# (i.e. - list, tuple, set)

print(list(zipped))	
[(1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C'), (4, 'D')]

print(tuple(zipped))
((1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C'), (4, 'D'))
--------------------------------
# notice inner lists don't use `[]` brackets

# Using zip function to unzip already zipped object to retrieve iterables/values

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
characters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
zipped = zip(numbers, characters)

n,c = zip(*zipped)
print(n)
print(c)
------------------------------------
[1, 2, 3, 4]
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```
