## Lambda Expressions
Sometimes, naming a function is not worth the trouble. For example, when you're sure the function will be used only once.
You can use lambda expressions to create anonymous functions -- functions that don't have a name.

With a lambda expression, this function:
```py
def multiply(x, y):
	return x * y
```

can be reduced to:
```py
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y

```

Either function can be accessed via a function call:
```py
multiply(4, 7)
# returns 28
```

#### Components of a Lambda Function
> 1. The `[[lambda]]` keyword is used to indicate that this is a lambda expression.
> 2. Following `lambda` are one or more arguments for the anonymous function separated by commas, followed by a colon `:`. Similar to functions, the way the arguments are named in a lambda expression is arbitrary.
> 3. Last is an expression that is evaluated and returned in a this function. This is a lot like an expression you might see as a return statement in a function.
> *Lambda functions has no body, no `return` statement, and does not require `def` keyword*

```py
add_one = lambda x: x + 1

>>> add_one(3)
4
```
