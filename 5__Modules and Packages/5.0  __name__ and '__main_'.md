#  __name__ and "__main__"
---
Syntax:
```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
	...
```

### Summary:
+ The `__name__` is a special built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module
+ The value of `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` when a module is run as the main program. Otherwise, the value of `__name__` is set to contain the name of the module
+ We use `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to prevent certain code from being run when the module is imported

### Deep Dive:
Sometimes when you are importing from a [[module]], you might want to know whether a modules function is being used as an import, or if you are using the original .py file of that module.

Unlike many other languages, Python does not have a `main()` function that is called at the top of a file that gets run automatically.

Instead, all code in a Python file at *indentation level 0* runs implicitly.

Python also has a built-in variable `__name__` that gets assigned a string based on how you are running the script.

For example, calling a Python script in the terminal `python one.py` will assign the string `"__main__"` to the `__name__` variable:

```py
>>> python one.py
-----------------
# one.py
...

__name__ == "__main__"	

```

Even though the `__name__ == "__main__"	` block is assigned behind the scenes, it still allows users to modify it in an if-block
```py
# one.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
	do something				# condition will run if the one.py script is called directly
```

To understand this more, lets say you have two Python files: one.py and two.py
```py
# one.py

def func():
	print("FUNC() IN ONE.PY")

print("TOP LEVEL IN ONE.PY")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print('ONE.PY is being run directly')
else:	# uncommon to use else-block
	print('ONE.PY has been imported')
	
---------------------------------------

# two.py
import one

print("TOP LEVEL IN TWO.PY")

one.func()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	print("TWO.PY is being run directly")
else:
	print("ONE.PY has been imported")

```
