# Variables 
---

> **Variables**: Labels for objects in Python.

### Variable Assignment
```py
x = 3
y = 4
z = 5

#alternate
x, y, z = 3, 4, 5
```

#### Swapping Variables In-Place:
The standard way in programming to swap variables is to use a temp variable - however, Python offers a short-hand for in-place variable swapping.
```py
a = 23
b = 42

# classic way
tmp = a
a = b
b = tmp

# in-place
a, b = b, a


```



#### Naming Variables:
+ Variable names should be descriptive
+ Variable names are case-sensitive
+ Variable names cannot have spaces
+ Variable names need to start with a letter or underscore
+ Variable names cannot use [reserved words] or built-in identifiers
+ Best Practice: all lowercase with underscores to separate words
