# Python Basics


### Comments
Comments can be used to help explain your code and make things clearer. There are three types of comments:
1. Single-Line
2. Multi-Line
3. [[#Docstrings]]

```python

# This is a Single-Line Comment

# This is a multi-
# line comment

""" 
	This is also
	a
	Multi-Line
	Comment
"""
```

#### Docstrings
Docstrings are similar to multi-line comments, but are specifically used to explain the purpose of a function and how it should be used.

Single line docstrings are perfectly acceptable.

```python
# Example of Docstring below function definition

def population_density(population, land_area):
	"""Calculate the population density of an area.
	
	INPUT:
	population: int. The population of that area
	land_area: int or float. This function is unit-agnostic and works for both km and miles.
	
	OUTPUT:
	population_density: population / land_area. The population density of the input.
	"""
	
	return population / land_area
```

### Printing / Output
Use the `print` built-in method to render output to the console.
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
