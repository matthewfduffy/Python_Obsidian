# Operators
## Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

| Symbol | Operation                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| +      | Addition                                       |
| -      | Subtraction                                    |
| *      | Multiplication                                 |
| /      | Division                                       |
| %      | Mod (the remainder after dividing)             |
| **     | Exponentiation (^ DOES NOT do this operation)  |
| //     | Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer | <br>


## Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

| Symbol | Example  | Same As   |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| =      | x = 5    | x = 5     |
| +=     | x += 3   | x = x + 3 |
| -=     | x -= 3   | x = x - 3 |
| `*=`   | x `*= 3` | x = x * 3 |
| /=     | x /= 3   | x = x / 3 | <br>


## Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator | Name                     | Example |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| ==       | Equal                    | x == y  |
| !=       | Not Equal                | X != y  |
| >        | Greater than             | x > y   |
| <        | Less than                | x < y   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | x <= y  |  <br>

## Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

| Operator | Description                                             | Example               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| and      | Returns True if both statements are true                | x < 5 and x < 10      |
| or       | Returns True if one of the statements is true           | x < 5 or x < 4        |
| not      | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) | <br>


## Identity Operators:
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

| Operator | Description                                            | Example    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| is       | Returns True if both variables are the same object     | x is y     |
| is not   | Returns True if both variables are not the same object | x is not y | <br>


## Membership Operators:
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

| Operator | Description                                                                      | Example    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| in       | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object     | x in y     |
| not in   | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object | x not in y | <br>

## Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

| Operator | Name                 | Description                                                                                             |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &        | AND                  | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1                                                                   |
| `|`      | OR                   | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1                                                              |
| ^        | XOR                  | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1                                                         |
| ~        | NOT                  | Inverts all the bits                                                                                    |
| <<       | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off                        |
| >>       | Signed right shift   | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |  <br>

### 'is' vs. '= ='
`is` expressions evaluate to `True` if two variables point to the same object.
`==` evaluates to `True` if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.

```py
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a

a is b	# True
a == b	# True

c = list(a)
a == c	# True
a is c	# False
```



#### Checking Object's Type:
You can check the type by using the `type()` function:
```py
>>> print(type(x))
int

>>> print(type(y))
float
```
