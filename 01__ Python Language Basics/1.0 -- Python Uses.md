## Applications for Python
Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.
-   The [Python Package Index](http://pypi.org) lists thousands of third party modules for Python.

## Web and Internet Development
Python offers many choices for [web development](http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebProgramming):

-   Frameworks such as [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/).
-   Micro-frameworks such as [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/).
-   Advanced content management systems such as [Plone](http://www.plone.org/) and [django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/).

Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:

-   [HTML and XML](http://docs.python.org/library/markup)
-   [JSON](http://docs.python.org/library/json.html)
-   [E-mail processing](http://docs.python.org/library/email).
-   Support for [FTP](http://docs.python.org/library/ftplib.html), [IMAP](http://docs.python.org/2/library/imaplib.html), and other [Internet protocols](http://docs.python.org/library/internet).
-   Easy-to-use [socket interface](http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html).

And the Package Index has yet more libraries:

-   [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), a powerful HTTP client library.
-   [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.
-   [Feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/) for parsing RSS/Atom feeds.
-   [Paramiko](https://pypi.org/project/paramiko/), implementing the SSH2 protocol.
-   [Twisted Python](http://twistedmatrix.com/), a framework for asynchronous network programming.

## Scientific and Numeric
Python is widely used in [scientific and numeric](http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific) computing:

-   [SciPy](http://scipy.org/) is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
-   [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data analysis and modeling library.
-   [IPython](http://ipython.org/) is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.
-   The [Software Carpentry Course](http://software-carpentry.org) teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials.

## Education
Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.

-   Books such as [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/), [Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/), and [Practical Programming](http://pragprog.com/book/gwpy2/practical-programming).
-   The [Education Special Interest Group](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig) is a good place to discuss teaching issues.

## Desktop GUIs
The [Tk](http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.
Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:

-   [wxWidgets](http://www.wxpython.org/)
-   [Kivy](http://kivy.org/), for writing multitouch applications.
-   Qt via [pyqt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) or [pyside](http://www.pyside.org/)

Platform-specific toolkits are also available:

-   [GTK+](http://www.pygtk.org/)
-   Microsoft Foundation Classes through the [win32 extensions](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)

## Software Development
Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.

-   [SCons](http://www.scons.org/) for build control.
-   [Buildbot](http://buildbot.sourceforge.net/) and [Apache Gump](http://gump.apache.org/) for automated continuous compilation and testing.
-   [Roundup](http://roundup.sourceforge.net/) or [Trac](http://www.edgewall.com/trac/) for bug tracking and project management.

## Business Applications
Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:

-   [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications.
-   [Tryton](http://www.tryton.org/) is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.
