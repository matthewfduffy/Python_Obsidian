# Iterators and Generators
[[iterable]]s are objects that can return one of their elements at a time (e.g. - list). Built-in functions like [[enumerate]] return an iterator.

An [[iterator]]  is an object that represents a stream of data. This is different from a *list*, which is also an iter**able**, but is not an iter**ator** because it is not a stream of data.

A [[generator]] is a simple way to create [[iterator]]s using functions. You can define an iterator using *classes*

Sample generator function:
```py
# produces an iterator that is a stream of numbers 
# from 0 to (x-1)

def my_range(x):
	i = 0
	while i < x:
		yield i
		i += 1
		
# Notice that instead of using the `return` keyword
# the generator uses `yield`. 
```

Notice that instead of using the `return` keyword, this function uses `yield`
**[[yield]]** is what allows the function to return values one at a time, and start where it left off each time it's called.
 The `yield` keyword is what differentiates a **generator** from a typical function.

Since this returns an iterator, we can convert it to a list or iterate through it in a loop to view its contents:
```py
for x in my_range(5):
	print(x)
	
""" 
	Output:
	0
	1
	2
	3
	4
"""
```
