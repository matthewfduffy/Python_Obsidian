# Call Stacks and Execution Frames
---
A recursive approach requires the function invoking itself with different arguments. 
How does the computer keep track of the various arguments and different function invocations if it’s the same function definition?

Repeatedly invoking functions may be familiar when it occurs sequentially, but it can be jarring to see this invocation occur within a function definition.

Languages make this possible with **call stacks** and **execution contexts**.

_Stacks_, a data structure, follow a strict protocol for the order data enters and exits the structure: the last thing to enter is the first thing to leave. LIFO

Your programming language often manages the call stack, which exists outside of any specific function. 
This call stack tracks the ordering of the different function invocations, so the last function to enter the call stack is the first function to exit the call stack.

We can think of execution contexts as the specific values we plug into a function call.
```
A function which adds two numbers:

Invoking the function with 3 and 4 as arguments...

execution context:
X = 3
Y = 4

Invoking the function with 6 and 2 as arguments...
execution context:

X = 6
Y = 2
```
Consider a pseudo-code function which sums the integers in an array:
```
function, sum_list

 if list has a single element

 return that single element

 otherwise...

 add first element to value of sum_list called with every element minus the first
```
This function will be invoked as many times as there are elements within the list! Let’s step through:
```
CALL STACK EMPTY
___________________

Our first function call...

sum_list([5, 6, 7])


CALL STACK CONTAINS
___________________
sum_list([5, 6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [5, 6, 7]
___________________

Base case, a list of one element not met.
We invoke sum_list with the list of [6, 7]...


CALL STACK CONTAINS
___________________
sum_list([6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [6, 7]
___________________
sum_list([5, 6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [5, 6, 7]
___________________

Base case, a list of one element not met.
We invoke sum_list with the list of [7]...

CALL STACK CONTAINS
___________________
sum_list([7])
with the execution context of a list being [7]
___________________
sum_list([6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [6, 7]
___________________
sum_list([5, 6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [5, 6, 7]
___________________

We've reached our base case! List is one element.

We return that one element.
This return value does two things:

1) "pops" sum_list([7]) from CALL STACK.
2) provides a return value for sum_list([6, 7])

----------------

CALL STACK CONTAINS

___________________

sum_list([6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [6, 7]

RETURN VALUE = 7
___________________

sum_list([5, 6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [5, 6, 7]
___________________

sum_list([6, 7]) waits for the return value of sum_list([7]), which it just received.
sum_list([6, 7]) has resolved and "popped" from the call stack...

----------------

CALL STACK contains
___________________

sum_list([5, 6, 7])
with the execution context of a list being [5, 6, 7]

RETURN VALUE = 6 + 7
___________________

sum_list([5, 6, 7]) waits for the return value of sum_list([6, 7]), which it just received.
sum_list([5, 6, 7]) has resolved and "popped" from the call stack.

----------------

CALL STACK is empty
___________________

RETURN VALUE = (5 + 6 + 7) = 18
```


## Building Our Own Call Stack

The best way to understand recursion is with lots of practice! At first, this method of solving a problem can seem unfamiliar but by the end of this lesson, we’ll have implemented a variety of algorithms using a recursive approach.

Before we dive into recursion, let’s replicate what’s happening in the call stack with an iterative function.

The call stack is abstracted away from us in Python, but we can recreate it to understand how recursive calls build up and resolve.

Let’s write a function that sums every number from 1 to the given input.
```py
sum_to_one(4)  
# 10  
sum_to_one(11)  
# 66
```
To depict the steps of a recursive function, we’ll use a call stack and execution contexts for each function call.

The call stack stores each function (with its internal variables) until those functions resolve in a last in, first out order.
```py
call_stack = []  
recursive_func()  
call_stack = [recursive_func_1]  
 
# within the body of recursive_func, another call to recursive_func()  
call_stack = [recursive_func_1, recursive_func_2]  
# the body of the second call to recursive_func resolves...  
call_stack = [recursive_func_1]  
# the body of the original call to recursive_func resolves...  
call_stack = []
```
Execution contexts are a mapping between variable names and their values within the function during execution. We can use a list for our call stack and a dictionary for each execution context.

```py
def sum_to_one(n):  
	result = 1  
	call_stack = []  
	while n != 1:  
		execution_context = {"n_value": n}  
		call_stack.append(execution_context)  
		n -= 1  
		print(call_stack)  
	print("BASE CASE REACHED")  

	while len(call_stack) != 0:  
		return_value = call_stack.pop()  
		print(call_stack)  
		result += return_value['n_value']  
		print(result, call_stack)  
		return result, call_stack  
  
sum_to_one(4)
```
