# (Modules) Decimals

Let’s say you are writing software that handles monetary transactions. If you used Python’s built-in [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) to calculate a sum, it would result in a weirdly formatted number.

```py
cost_of_gum = 0.10
cost_of_gumdrop = 0.35

cost_of_transaction = cost_of_gum + cost_of_gumdrop
# Returns 0.44999999999999996
```

Being familiar with rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic you want to use a data type that performs decimal arithmetic more accurately. You could do the following:
```py
from decimal import Decimal

cost_of_gum = Decimal('0.10')
cost_of_gumdrop = Decimal('0.35')

cost_of_transaction = cost_of_gum + cost_of_gumdrop
# Returns 0.45 instead of 0.44999999999999996
```

Above, we use the decimal module’s Decimal data type to add 0.10 with 0.35. Since we used the Decimal type the arithmetic acts much more as expected.
