# Python Standard Library

Python supplies several built-in objects. All built-in objects are attributes of a preloaded module named `__builtin__`

When Python loads a module, the module automatically gets an extra attribute named `__builtins__` which refers either to module `__builtin` or to `__builtin__`'s dictionary.

Note the difference between the name of the attribute (`__builtins__`) and the name of the module (`__builtin__`).
When a global variable is not found in the current module, Python looks for the identifier in the current module's __builtins__ before raising a *NameError*
