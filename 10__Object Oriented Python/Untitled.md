These are the essential differences:

#### ðŸ”¸ **Class Attributes**

-   They belong to the class.
    
-   There is only one copy of each class attribute.
    
-   Changing their value affects all instances since they all take the value from the same source.
    

#### ðŸ”¹ **Instance Attributes**

-   They belong to the instances.
    
-   Each instance has a separate copy of each instance attribute.
    
-   Changing their value only affects a particular instance and the others remain unchanged.


A Class in Python:
```py
class Dog:
	"""A simple attempt to model a dog."""
	
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		"""Initialize name and age attributes."""
		self.name = name
		self.age = age

duncan = Dog()	# instantiating an object from class 'Dog'
```
