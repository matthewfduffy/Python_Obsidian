### Character Classes:
| Symbol | Use                                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\d`   | Returns a match where the string contains any numeric digit [0-9]                                                                      |
| `\D`   | Returns a match where the string does not contain digits                                                                               |
| `\s`   | Returns a match where the string contains a white space characters (space, newline, tab)                                               |
| `\S`   | match characters that are NOT spaces, tab, or newline                                                                                  |
| `\w`   | Returns a match where the string contains any word characters <br> (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and underscore_character) | 
| `\W`   | match characters that are NOT words, digits or underscore                                                                              |


### Character Ranges `[]`:
Character ranges are declared inside square brackets `[]`.
Each character-range represents a single position in a string.
For example, the regex `[013][FXB]` would be used to check, whether in a two-character string, that:
- the first character matched 0, 1, or 3
- the second character matched F, X, or B

Similarly, ranges can be used with `-`
`[1-4][A-Z]` would be used to check, whether in a two-character string, that:
- the first character is 1, 2, 3, or 4
- the second character is an uppercase letter in the alphabet


### Negate Strings `^`:
To negate characters, meaning you want anything but the specified characters, start your character range with a carrot `^`

For example, we can qualify non-vowel letters:
```
REGEX:	[^AEIOU]
INPUT:	X
OUTPUT:	True

REGEX:	[^AEIOU]
INPUT:	E
OUTPUT:	False
```

### Anchors `^` & `$`:
Sometimes you will want to qualify the start `^` and end `$` of a line or string.

For example, the following regex can be used to match all numbers that start a line in a document.
```
REGEX:	^[0-9]
INPUT:	ALPHA 1 34 234
OUTPUT:	False

REGEX:	^[0-9]
INPUT:	10 443 129 2
OUTPUT:	True
```

Depending on your environment, using both the start-of-line ^ and end-of-line $ together can be helpful to force a full match and ignore partial ones. This is because qualifying the start ^ and end $ of a string forces everything between them to be the only contents allowed in the input.

```
REGEX:	[0-9][0-9]
INPUT:	1432
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	^[0-9][09]$
INPUT:	1432
MATCH:	False
```

### Quantifiers 
#### Fixed Repetitions `{n}`
Quantifiers repeat the preceding clause of a regular expression and can be used to circumvent fixed repetitions.

For example, to validate a string is of length three (3) all upper-case letters, your regex would be:
`[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]`
```
REGEX:	[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]
INPUT:	YMCA
MATCH:	True
```

This can be simplified using a quantifier `{4}` to specify repeating the character range three times.
```
REGEX:	[A-Z]{4}
INPUT:	YMCA
Match:	True
```

#### Min and Max Repetitions `{n, m}`
You can also express a minimum and maximum number of allowable repetitions. 
`[A-Z]{2,3}` will require a minimum of 2 repetitions but a maximum of 3.
```
REGEX:	[A-Z]{2,3}
INPUT:	YCA
Match:	True

REGEX:	[A-Z]{2,3}
INPUT:	AZ
Match:	True
```

Leaving the second argument empty and having a comma still present will result in an infinite maximum, and therefore specify a minimum. Below, we have a regex that will match on a minimum of two alphanumeric characters.
```
REGEX:	[A-Za-z0-9]{2,}
INPUT:	YZ1
Match:	True

REGEX:	[A-Za-z0-9]{2,}
INPUT:	YZSDjhfhSBH2342SDFSDFsdfw123412
Match:	True
```

#### 0 or 1 Repetition (aka - Optional)
For instance, a question mark ? is the same as {0,1}, which makes that part of the regex optional. If you wanted two uppercase alphabetic characters to optionally be preceded with a number, you can do so like this:
```
REGEX:	[0-9]?[A-Z]{2}
INPUT:	BC
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	[0-9]?[A-Z]{2}
INPUT:	3BC
MATCH:	True
```

This optional-character is helpful when building regex's that might receive different acceptable inputs (e.g. - phone numbers)
```
# Phone Number with dashes only 123-456-7891
REGEX:	[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}
INPUT:	555-790-8345
MATCH: 	True

# Same REGEX against a phone number without dashes 1234567891
REGEX:	[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}
INPUT:	5557908345
MATCH: 	False

# Using the optional flag
REGEX:	[0-9]{3}-?[0-9]{3}-?[0-9]{4}
INPUT:	555-790-8345
MATCH: 	True

```

### 1 or More Repetitions `+`
A `+` is shorthand for `{1,}` which requires a minimum of 1 repetition, but will capture any number of repetitions after that.
```
REGEX:	[XYZ]+
INPUT:	Z
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	[XYZ]+
INPUT:	XYZZZYZXXX
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	[XYZ]+[0-9]+
INPUT:	XYZZZYZXXX2374676128963453452990
MATCH:	True
```

### 0 or More Repetitions `*`
A `*` is a shorthand for `{0,}`, which makes whatever it is quantifying completely optional, but will capture as many repetitions it can if they do exist.
```
REGEX:	[0-3]+[XYZ]*
INPUT:	34
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	[0-3]+[XYZ]*
INPUT:	34YYXZZ
MATCH:	True
```


### Wildcards `.`
A dot `.` is a wildcard for any character, making it the broadest operator you can use. It will match not just alphabetic or numeric characters, but also whitespaces, newlines, punctuation, and any other symbols.

```
REGEX:	...
INPUT:	B/C
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	.{3}
INPUT:	B/C
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	H.{3}0
INPUT:	Hello
MATCH:	True
```

A common operation you may see is `.*`, which allows 0 or more repetitions of any character. 
This is often used to match any text, making it function as an “everything” wildcard. T
his can be helpful when using regular expressions as qualifiers, and if you do not want that parameter to restrict anything just make it a `.*`.
```
REGEX:	.*
INPUT:	AsdfSJDFJSVdsfBLKJXCasdBNVJWB$TJ$@#ASDFSD@
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	.*
INPUT:	Alpha
MATCH:	True
```

### Grouping
It can be helpful to group up parts of a regular expression in parentheses, often to use a quantifier on that whole group. For instance, if you want to qualify an uppercase letter followed by three numeric digits, but want to repeat that whole operation with a quantifier, you can do so like this:

```
REGEX:	([A-Z][0-9]{3})+
INPUT:	A563
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	([A-Z][0-9]{3})+
INPUT:	A563X264
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	([A-Z][0-9]{3}-?)+
INPUT:	A563-X264-C578
MATCH:	True
```

If we wanted to identify phone numbers (with optional dashes -), but make the area code (the first three digits) optional, we can do so like this:
```
REGEX:	([0-9]{3}-)?[0-9]{3}-?[0-9]{4}
INPUT:	470-127-7501
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	([0-9]{3}-)?[0-9]{3}-?[0-9]{4}
INPUT:	127-7501
MATCH:	True
```

### Alteration `|`
Alternation is expressed with a `|` and essentially operates as an “OR”. It alternates two or more valid patterns where at least one of those patterns must match in that position.

For instance, if we want to capture 5-digit U.S. ZIP codes that end in “35” or “75,” we can tail a repeated numeric range with a (35|75). We must group that in parentheses so the | does not mangle the 35 with the repeated numeric range.

```
REGEX:	[0-9]{3}(35|75)
INPUT:	75035
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	[0-9]{3}(35|75)
INPUT:	75062
MATCH:	False
```

Sometimes an alternator is used simply to qualify a set of literal values. For instance, if I want to only match ALPHA, BETA, and GAMMA, I can use an alternator to achieve this.
```
REGEX:	ALPHA|BETA|GAMMA
INPUT:	BETA
MATCH:	True

REGEX:	ALPHA|BETA|GAMMA
INPUT:	DELTA
MATCH:	False
```


### Prefixes and Suffixes
Especially when you are scanning documents, it can be helpful to qualify something that precedes or follows your targeted text without capturing it. Prefixes and suffixes allow this, and can be leveraged with `(?<=regex)` and `(?=regex)` respectively, where “regex” is the pattern for the head or tail you want to qualify but not include.

For instance, if I want to extract numbers that are preceded by uppercase letters, but I don’t want to include those letters, I can use a prefix like this:
```
REGEX:	(?<=[A-Z]+)[0-9]+
INPUT:	ALPHA12
MATCH:	12

REGEX:	(?<=[A-Z]+)[0-9]+
INPUT:	167
MATCH:	False
```
A suffix works similarly, but matches a tail without including that tail.
```
REGEX:	[0-9]+(?=[A-Z]+)
INPUT:	12ALPHA
MATCH:	12

REGEX:	[0-9]+(?=[A-Z]+)
INPUT:	167
MATCH:	False
```

## Conclusions

It is important to remember that you often only need to make a regular expression as specific as it needs to be, depending on how predictable your data is. Qualifying a number with `[0-9.]+` will work to match an IP address such as 172.18.83.200. But keep in mind it will also match 237476231.345342342334.23423756756856234, which is definitely not an IP address. If you do not know your data well, you should probably err on being more specific, as demonstrated in this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284147/validating-ipv4-addresses-with-regexp).

Regular expressions may seem niche, but they can rise up heroically to the most unexpected tasks in your day-to-day work. Hopefully this article has helped you feel more comfortable with regular expressions and find them useful. They can assist in data munging, qualification, categorization, and parsing as well as document editing.
