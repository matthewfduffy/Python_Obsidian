# .sub()
The `sub()` function is used to replace any matched text with the given text of your choice. 

It is one of the most used functions in python for text manipulation and cleaning.

The `sub()` function takes 3 parameters:
+ `pattern` — the first parameter is the regex expression that you want to match.
+ `custom text` — the text that you want the matched patterns to replace with.
+ `original text` — the original string or data that you want to manipulate.


```python
import re

text_data = "This is a sample text for testing our regex sub function."
result = re.sub('\s', '-', text_data)

print(result)
# "This-is-a-sample-text-to-test-our-regex-sub-function"
```
