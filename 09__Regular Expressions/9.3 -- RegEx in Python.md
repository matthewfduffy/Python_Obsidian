# Regular Expressions in Python
To work with regex in Python, we need to import a built-in module named `re`

```python
import re
	...
```

#### Python functions for Regex

| Method         | Use                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `re.compile()` | to create a regex object                                                                     |
| `re.findall()` | find all patterns in this string and returns all the matches in it, not just the first match |
| `re.search()`  | find a pattern in a string                                                                   |
| `re.match()`   | does this entire string conform to this pattern?                                             |
| `re.group()`   | to get the matched string                                                                    |


### .findall()
The find all function returns a list of all the strings (or sub-strings) that matches your pattern.
```python
import re

text_data = "This is a sample text for testing our regex findall function."

matches = re.findall('t..t', text_data)

print(matches)	# ['text', 'test']
```
Here we are matching `t..t` that means that in our pattern we only need to first and the last letter as ‘t’ and we want two characters between which could be anything.

If no matches are found, an empty list is returned from the function.


### .search()
The search function, just like _findall_ function searches for the occurrence of the pattern, but instead of returning a list of all matches, it _returns a match object of the first occurrence in the data._
```python
import re

text_data = "This is a sample text for testing our regex findall function."

match_obj = re.search('t..t', text_data)

print(match_obj.span())			# (17, 21)
```
You can also access the index using `span()`, `start()`, `end()` for the whole span, the start index, or the last index respectively.

If there are no matches then the search function returns `None` in python and if there are multiple matches, it only returns the first occurrence of the match.
