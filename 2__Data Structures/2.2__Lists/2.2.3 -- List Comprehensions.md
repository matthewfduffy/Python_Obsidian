## List Comprehensions
---
List comprehension is a way to elegantly create lists using `for` loops, and is also the backbone of One-Lining. For example:
```py
nums = []
for n in range(10):
	nums.append(n)
```
can be shortened to:
```py
nums = [ n for n in range(10)]
```

### For Loops as a list comprehension:
You can simplify light operations (e.g. - `for` loops) using list comprehension
```py
# syntax
new_list = [<expression> for <element> in <collection>]
```

```py
# standard for loop
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = []

for number in numbers:
	doubled.append(number * 2)

print(doubled)
------------------
# [4, -2, 158, 66, -90]
___________________________________

# same problem with a list comprehension
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers]

print(doubled)
-----------------
# [4, -2, 158, 66, -90]

___________________________________

# Alternate Example
grades = [90, 88, 62, 76, 74, 89, 48, 57]
# add 10 to each grade
scaled_grades = [grade + 10 for grade in grades]

print(scaled_grades)
# [100, 98, 72, 86, 84, 99, 58, 67]
```

### List Comprehensions: Conditionals 
```py
# Without List Comprehensions
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
only_negative_doubled = []

for num in numbers:
	if num < 0:
		only_negative_doubled.append(num * 2)

print(only_negative_doubled)
# [-2, -90]
```

Now, here is what our code would look like using a list comprehension:
```py
# with List Comprehension
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
negative_doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers if num < 0]
print(negative_doubled)
# [-2, -90]
```

In our `negative_doubled` example, our list comprehension:

1.  Takes an element in the list `numbers`.
2.  Assigns that element to a variable called `num`.
3.  Checks if the condition `num < 0` is met by the element stored in `num`. If so, it goes to step 4, otherwise it skips it and goes to the next element in the list.
4.  Applies the expression `num * 2` on the element stored in `num` and adds the result to a new list called `negative_doubled`
5.  Repeats steps 1-3 (and sometimes 4) for every other element in the `numbers` list.

### List Comprehensions: If Else
We can also use If-Else conditions directly in our comprehensions. For example, let’s say we wanted to double every negative number but triple all positive numbers. Here is what our code might look like:

```py
# IF ELSE
# doubling negative but triple all positives
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 if num < 0 else num * 3 for num in numbers]
print(doubled)
# [6, -2, 237, 99, -90]
```

This is a bit different than our previous comprehension since the conditional `if num < 0 else num * 3` comes after the expression `num * 2` but before our `for` keyword.

Let’s write our own list comprehensions with conditionals!

```py
heights = [161, 164, 156, 144, 158, 170, 163, 163, 157]
# find those who can ride roller coaster based on height
can_ride_coaster = [height for height in heights if height > 161]

print(can_ride_coaster)
```


### List Comprehensions: Generator Expressions
Here's a cool concept that combines generators and list comprehensions! You can actually create a generator in the same way you'd normally write a list comprehension, except with parentheses instead of square brackets. For example:
```py
sq_list = [x**2 for x in range(10)]		# produces a list of squares
sq_iterator = (x**2 for x in range(10))	# produces an iterator of squares
```
