# Joining Strings
---
`.join()` is essentially the opposite of .split(), it joins a list of strings together with a given delimiter. 

The syntax of .join() is:
`'delimiter'.join(list_you_want_to_join)`

With `.split()` the argument was the delimiter, but now the argument is the list. 

This is because join is still a string method, which means it has to act on a string. The string .join() acts on is the delimiter you want to join with, therefore the list you want to join has to be the argument.
```py
my_munequita = ['My', 'Spanish', 'Harlem', 'Mona', 'Lisa']

print(' '.join(my_munequita))
# => 'My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa'
--------------------------------------------------------
my_munequita = ['My', 'Spanish', 'Harlem', 'Mona', 'Lisa']
my_munequita_csv = ','.join(my_munequita)
print(my_munequita_csv)
# => 'My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa'
```

We take the list of strings, `my_munequita`, and we joined it together with our delimiter, `' '`, which is a space. 

The space is important if you are trying to build a sentence from words, otherwise, we would have ended up with:
```py
...
print(''.join(my_munequita))

# => 'MySpanishHarlemMonaLisa'
```
