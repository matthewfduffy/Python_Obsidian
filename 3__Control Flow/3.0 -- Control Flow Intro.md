#### If Statement
An `if` statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's an example:
```py
if phone_balance < 5:
	phone_balance += 10
	bank_balance -= 10
```

#### Elif...Else
In addition to the `if` clause, there are two optional clauses often used with an `if` statement.
```py
if season == 'spring':
	print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
	print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
	print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
	print('stay indoors!')
else:
	print('unrecognized season')
```
