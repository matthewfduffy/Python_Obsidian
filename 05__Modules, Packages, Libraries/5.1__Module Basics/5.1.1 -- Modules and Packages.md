# Modules and Packages
--- 
![[Python-Mod-Script-or-Program.png]]

A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool. 
Modules are also often referred to as “libraries” or “packages” — a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.

Usually, _modules_ will provide functions or data types that we can then use to solve a general problem, allowing us more time to focus on the software that we are building to solve a more specific problem.

A _package_ is simply a module that contains sub-modules. A sub-module is specified with dot `.` notation.

Python comes with a standard library of packages. See [[5.1.2 -- The Standard Library]]

## Techniques for Importing Modules:
1. To import an individual function or class from a module:
```python
from module_name import object_name
```
---
2. To import multiple, individual objects from a module:
```python
from module_name import first_object, second_object
```
---
3. To rename a module (aliasing):
```python
import module_name as new_name
```
---
4. To import an object from a module and rename it:
```python
from module_name import object name as new_name
```

---
5. To import every object individually from a module:
```python
from module_name import *
```

> **Note:** *Do Not Use This Approach*. Importing an entire module, unless it is absolutely necessary, can lead to a cluttered local namespace and adds unnecessary weight to a project
---
6. Standard Import:
If you really want to use all of the objects from a module, use the standard import `module_name` statement instead and access each of the objects with dot `.` notation.
```python
import module_name
```
---
7. To import sub-modules:
```python
import package_name.sub_module_name
```

---
### Example Usage:
```python
# datetime module
from datetime import datetime

current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)
```

```python
# random module
import random

random_list = [random.randint(1, 100) for x in range(101)]
 
randomer_number = random.choice(random_list)

print(randomer_number)
```

---
### Aliasing:
Notice that when we want to invoke the `randint()` function we call `random.randint()`
This is the default behavior where Python offers a *namespace* for the module. A namespace isolates the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module from the code in the file doing the importing. Your local namespace, meanwhile, is where your code is run.

Python defaults to naming the namespace after the module being imported, but sometimes this name could be ambiguous or lengthy. 
Sometimes, the module’s name could also conflict with an object you have defined within your local namespace.

Fortunately, this name can be altered by aliasing using the as keyword:
`import module_name as name_you_pick_for_the_module`

Aliasing is most often done if the name of the library is long and typing the full name every time you want to use one of its functions is laborious.

You might also occasionally encounter import `*`. The `*` is known as a “wildcard” and matches anything and everything.  
_This syntax is considered dangerous because it could pollute our local namespace. _

Pollution occurs when the same name could apply to two possible things. 
For example, if you happen to have a function floor() focused on floor tiles, using `from math import *` would also import a function `floor()` that rounds down floats.

---
### Third-Party Libraries:
To use third-party libraries, those not included in the Python Standard Library, you will need to install them using pip or similar package manager (e.g. - `conda`, `pipenv`).

To install a package (using `pip`), run `pip install` followed by the package name in your command line: `pip install flask`.
This downloads and installs the package so that it's available to import in your programs.

Once installed, you can import third-party packages using the same syntax used to import from the standard library.

> **PyPI** is a repository for open-source third-party Python packages similar to *RubyGems* and *NPM* for Node.js
> 
> **PIP** comes installed with Python by default if Python was installed from python.org or through the Anaconda distribution

### Using a `requirements.txt` File
Larger Python programs might depend on dozens of third party packages. To make it easier to share these programs, programmers often list a project's dependencies in a file called requirements.txt. This is an example of a requirements.txt file.

```txt
beautifulsoup4==4.5.1
bs4==0.0.1
pytz==2016.7
requests==2.11.1
```

Each line of the file includes the name of a package and its version number. The version number is optional, but it usually should be included. Libraries can change subtly, or dramatically, between versions, so it's important to use the same library versions that the program's author used when they wrote the program.

You can use pip to install all of a project's dependencies at once by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line.
