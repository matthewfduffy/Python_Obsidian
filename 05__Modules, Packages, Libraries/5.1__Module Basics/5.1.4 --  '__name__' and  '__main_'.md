#  __name__ and __main__

> `__name__`
> Specially named variable allowing us to detect whether a module is ran as a script or imported into another module


Syntax:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	...
```

### Summary:
+ The `__name__` is a special built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module
+ The value of `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` when a module is run as the main program. Otherwise, the value of `__name__` is set to contain the name of the module
+ We use `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to prevent certain code from being run when the module is imported

### Deep Dive:
Sometimes when you are importing from a [[module]], you might want to know whether a modules function is being used as an import, or if you are using the original .py file of that module.

Unlike many other languages, Python does not have a `main()` function that is called at the top of a file that gets run automatically.

Instead, all code in a Python file at *indentation level 0* runs implicitly.

Python also has a built-in variable `__name__` that gets assigned a string based on how you are running the script.
