# Module Import Deep Dive

Consider the program below:
```python
# words.py
from urlib.request import urlopen


story = urlopen('http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt')
story_words = []
for line in story:
	line_words = lind.decode('utf-8').split()
	for word in line_words:
		story_words.append(word)
story.close()
```

In a terminal, running this program yields no response (expected).
```sh
$ python words.py
$
```

If we modify the program to print one word per line and call the same command, you will now see the output in the terminal.
```python
# words.py
from urlib.request import urlopen


story = urlopen('http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt')
story_words = []
for line in story:
	line_words = lind.decode('utf-8').split()
	for word in line_words:
		story_words.append(word)
story.close()

# added code below
for word in story_words:
	print(word)
```

```sh
$ python words.py
that
some
of
its 
noisest
...
```

If we were to take the same `words.py` and import it to the REPL, you'll see that you get the same result.
Notice the code is ran immediately, which might not be expected and isn't entirely useful.
```sh
$ python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Oct 17 2019, 14:41:32)
...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" for more information.
>>> import words
that
some
of
its
noisiest
...
```

To correct the concern above, we should put our code in a function.
```python
# words.py
from urlib.request import urlopen

# wrapping in function definition
def fetch_words():
	story = urlopen('http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt')
	story_words = []
	for line in story:
		line_words = lind.decode('utf-8').split()
		for word in line_words:
			story_words.append(word)
	story.close()

	for word in story_words:
		print(word)
```

Running the code above (imported into the REPL) will now import the program but not run it because the new function `fetch_words()` is not explicitly called.

```sh
$ python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Oct 17 2019, 14:41:32)
...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" for more information.
>>> import words
>>>
```

To run the program now, you must call the `fetch_words()` function with `words.fetch_words()`.
The use of this dot `.` is called "qualifying the function name with the module name".
```sh
...
>>> import words
>>> words.fetch_words()
that
some
of
its
noisiest
...
```

Rather than import the `words` module directly, we could also import the `fetch_words()` function directly.
```sh
>>> from words import fetch_words
>>> fetch_words()
```

Having imported the `fetch_words()` function directly into the REPL session, we can invoke `fetch_words()` using its unqualified name.

However, when we try to run the program directly now (outside the REPL), nothing happens. That is because all the module does now is define a function, and then exit.
```sh
$ python words.py
$
```

What we'd prefer, is that the function actually print something when we execute it.
To make a module that we can usefully import function into the REPL AND which can be ran as a script, we need to use the Python `__name__` idiom.

To see how, add `print(__name__)` to the end of your program.
```python
# words.py
from urlib.request import urlopen

# wrapping in function definition
def fetch_words():
	story = urlopen('http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt')
	story_words = []
	for line in story:
		line_words = lind.decode('utf-8').split()
		for word in line_words:
			story_words.append(word)
	story.close()

	for word in story_words:
		print(word)

		# added code below
print(__name__)
```

If you return to the REPL and import the modified `words.py` module, we can see that `__name__` does in fact evaluate to the module's name:
```sh
$ python
#Python 3.7.4 (default, Oct 17 2019, 14:41:32)
#...
#Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" for more information.
>>> import words
words		# result of print(__name__)
>>> import words
>>>			# Note**
```

Note: If you try to import the module again, the `print(name)` statement does not evaluate. Module code is only executed once on first import.

Now, try and run the program from as a script the operating system shell, outside the REPL.
```sh
$ python words.py
__main__
$
```
From here, you can see the dunder `__name__` special variable is equal to the string `__name__` special variable.
That is, Python sets the value of `__name__` differently depending on how our module is being used.
The key being introduced, is that our module can use this behavior to decide how to behave.

We replace the `print()` statement with an `if` statement which tests the value of `__name__`.
If `__name__` is equal to the string `__main__` we execute our function. On the other hand, if `__name__` is not equal to `__main__` the module knows it is being imported into another module and not being executed directly, so it will only define the fetch words function without executing it.

```python
# words.py
from urlib.request import urlopen

# wrapping in function definition
def fetch_words():
	story = urlopen('http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt')
	story_words = []
	for line in story:
		line_words = lind.decode('utf-8').split()
		for word in line_words:
			story_words.append(word)
	story.close()

	for word in story_words:
		print(word)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	fetch_words()
```

We can now safely import our module without erroneously executing our function, and we can usefully run our module as a script.
```sh
# Importing module
$ python
...
>>> import words
>>> 
>>> exit()

# run as script
$ python words.py
that
some
of
its
noisiest
...
```
