## Array Indexing:
Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.
You can access an array element by referring to its index number.
The indexes in `NumPy` arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.

```py
# Get the first element from the following array:
import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  
  
print(arr[0])

-----------------------------------------------
# Get third and fourth elements from the following array and add them.
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  
  
print(arr[2] + arr[3])
```

### Access 2-D Arrays:
To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.
```py
# Access the 2nd element on 1st dim:
import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])  
  
print('2nd element on 1st dim: ', arr[0, 1])

--------------------------------------------
# Access the 5th element on 2nd dim:
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])  
  
print('5th element on 2nd dim: ', arr[1, 4])
```

### Access 3-D Arrays:
To access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimensions and the index of the element.
```py
# Access the third element of the second array of the first array:

import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])  
  
print(arr[0, 1, 2])
```

##### Example Explained:

`arr[0, 1, 2]` prints the value `6`.

And this is why:

The first number represents the first dimension, which contains two arrays:  
`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`
and:  
`[[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]`  
Since we selected `0`, we are left with the first array:  
`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`

The second number represents the second dimension, which also contains two arrays:  
`[1, 2, 3]  `
and:  
`[4, 5, 6] ` 
Since we selected `1`, we are left with the second array:  
`[4, 5, 6]`

The third number represents the third dimension, which contains three values:  
4  
5  
6  
Since we selected `2`, we end up with the third value:  
6

### Negative Indexing:
```py
# Print the last element from the 2nd dim:
import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])  
  
print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])
```

## Array Slicing:
Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.
We pass slice instead of index like this: `[_start_:_end_]`.
We can also define the step, like this: `[_start_:_end_:_step_]`.
If we don't pass start its considered 0
If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension
If we don't pass step its considered 1

```py
# Slice elements from index 1 to index 5 from the following array:
import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])  
  
print(arr[1:5])
```
