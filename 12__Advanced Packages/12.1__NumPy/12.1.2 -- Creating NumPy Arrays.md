# Creating NumPy Arrays
---
We can create a NumPy `ndarray` object by using the `array()` function.
To create an `ndarray`, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the `array()` method, and it will be converted into an `ndarray`
```py
import numpy as np  
  
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
  
print(arr)  
  
print(type(arr))
# >>> numpy.ndarray
```

> *Nested Array*: arrays that have arrays as their elements.
