# NumPY Quick Start
---
- NumPy ("Numerical Python") is a Python library used for working with arrays that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently (also known as: locality of reference)
- NumPy is partially written in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
- The array object is called `ndarray`

Install:
```py
pip install numpy
```

Import:
```py
import numpy
```

Usage Example:
```py
import numpy

arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

Alias:
`np`
```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

Version:
`print(np.__version__)`
